> The program was created with coinbase pro in mind. The program works and has been tested on the coinbase pro exchange.

### Other possibilities
The program works on the basis of algorithms, so if you replace the api from another exchange and change the code so that it works for another exchange, the rest of the program should work. However, the program has not been tested for other exchanges, so it should be done on your own.
